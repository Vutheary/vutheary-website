        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Vutheary Phath, but you can also call me Vu.  I was born in Cambodia and moved to the United States when I was 9 nine years old, hoping for better education and jobs. Currently, I am a student at UCR majoring in Business Economics. I have always wanted to major in this field because one of my biggest dreams since I was a child, is to own a business that was created based on my interest. Since I was a child I dream of owning a business which is why majoring in Business Economics will be perfect for me. If later in life I wanted to change my mind and decided to drop the idea of having my own business and get a nine-to-five, with this major I can go into the accounting field as well. This reason is why I decided to major in this field with the hope that I will live a good life after receiving a degree in this field.
<br><br>

        I have not yet applied to any jobs because as of right now I just wanted to focus on my education. But even though I have never had a real job before I was able to obtain many experiences whenever I visited my relatives in Cambodia. My aunt is a teacher in Cambodia and would often hold an after-school class at her house. While many students are attending, my aunt decided it was a good idea to open a mini-market store so the student can buy some snacks before going into their extra hours of classes so they can get an extra lesson. So whenever I visited my aunt I would often help her run the mini-store with my others aunt. I was in charge of the money, I would be the cashier and would often make much interact with the students. I like working there because the student would often be friendly and I was able to receive many experiences like I would if I have a real job.
<br><br>

        I have also planned out what type of business I wanted to have as well. As of right now, I have three in mind; a make-up line, a body-care line, and a clothing line. Let's start with the make-up line I wanted to develop, I wanted to name the brand VUCOSTMETICS and the color theme of my brand will be pink silver, and white. My vision for this makeup brand is to create a product that acts like a makeup product and skincare at the same time. I wanted to create something that can you feel beautiful, while it making your skin more beautiful. As for the body-care line, I want to create a product line that uses natural products and helps those who feel insecure about their skin regarding bumpy and dryness. I wanted to name it VUSKIN and the color theme I have imagined and planned for this brand is gold, silver, and rose gold. Lastly, my vision for my clothing brand is to create a clothing piece that gives you the feeling of living in your clothes yet still feels and looks beautiful. I have yet to come up with a name for this brand, but I will for sure continued to work on it.
